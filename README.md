# Casimodo.Lib

My current toolbox for development of Web & XAML applications with .NET C# and JavaScript.
Some parts of my WPF frameworks + my Mojen (M Object Jennyrator) code generator.
Without examples - of which there are none yet and maybe never will be any - you'll most probably not be able to use any of this stuff without headaches or developing anger. As they say in the movies: I'm too old for this shit. Thus, keep away for your own sake ;-)
