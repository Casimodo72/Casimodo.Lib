# Casimodo.Lib

My current toolbox for development of Web & XAML applications with .NET C# and TypeScript.
Some WPF code + my Mojen (M Object Jennyrator) code generator.
Since Mojen consists of many tiny pieces which can put together in lots of ways + it's in a state of flux + I don't have enough time to produce examples: you'll most probably not be able to use any of this stuff without headaches. It's just a "me" repository.
